# CMAKE-IMGUI
Template Project for making ImGui Applications in CMAKE

This is beneficial for anyone interested in making an ImGui Application with CMAKE as a build system rather than using makefiles or visual studio.

You will need to install Glad and GLFW through a package manager - I suggest Conan or VCPKG
